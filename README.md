<h1>Deepwoken Overlay</h1>

> Planned: Echo Estimator, Build Helper

Echo Estimater - will take into account certain things, if you are a certain level, if will show how many echoes you will get. If you kill Kaido or do something that the overlay cannot track you will have to tick the checkbox

Build Helper - input a build stats and talents/mantras for said build. Build Helper will highlight what talents and mantras to take when you have the levelup screen open.
